# Advanced xv6 Kernel Enhancements

This repository contains an integrated suite of kernel extensions for the [xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2022/xv6.html) operating system, designed to enhance security, process management, scheduling, and memory handling. These features were developed as a comprehensive Operating Systems project for academic coursework.

## Features

- **Secure Shell Authentication**
  - Username/password login for xv6 shell
  - Configurable access attempts via Makefile macros

- **Process History and Access Control**
  - `history` command displays all executed processes with PID, name, and detailed memory usage across text, bss, data, stack, and heap segments
  - Dynamic blocking/unblocking of system calls for shell-spawned processes
  - User-level commands for managing syscall access (`block`, `unblock`)
  - File permission management implemented via custom `chmod` system call

- **Advanced Process Management & Scheduling**
  - Custom signal handling (SIGINT, SIGBG, SIGFG, SIGCUSTOM) for process termination, suspension, resumption, and user-defined actions, triggered by keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C/B/F/G)
  - Priority-based scheduler with dynamic process profiling (turnaround, waiting, response time, context switches)
  - Priority boosting to prevent starvation, with scheduling parameters tunable via Makefile
  - Support for delayed process activation and time-bounded execution via enhanced fork system call

- **Efficient Memory Management**
  - Real-time user-space memory monitoring across all active processes (invoked via keyboard interrupt)
  - Adaptive disk-based page swapping, supporting xv6 under a constrained 4MB physical memory limit
  - Page replacement policy with dynamic threshold adjustment and intelligent victim selection to optimize resource usage
